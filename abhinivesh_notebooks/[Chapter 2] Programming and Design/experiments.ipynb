If we know something about the structure of a distribution—perhaps it’s a Poisson distribution where λ = 5, perhaps it’s an empirical distribution with set probabilities for each outcome—we could do quite a bit: produce an exact Probability Distribution Function (PDF) or Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF), calculate expectations and do various operations eﬀiciently. But that isn’t the case for all the distributions we work with! What if the distribution comes from a complicated simulation? At the extreme, we might not be able to do anything except\n",
